# LSTM Model for Generating Pro-Brexit Tweets
This repository contains a word-based Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) neural network model trained on Pro-Brexit tweets. The model was designed to generate synthetic tweets resembling those in favor of Brexit. The training data was sourced from tweets available on GitHub, and the project demonstrates how LSTM models can be applied to generate text based on specific sentiment.

## Project Overview
The project aims to explore text generation techniques using neural networks, specifically the LSTM architecture, which is well-suited for sequential data like text. By focusing on Pro-Brexit tweets, the model generates tweets that follow the sentiment and style seen in the original dataset.
